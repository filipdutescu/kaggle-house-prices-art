# Housing Prices Advanced Regression Techniques
## Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my solution to the ***Housing Prices Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle Competition***.

The source code can be found in the following:
  * **Housing Prices Advanced Regression Techniques.ipynb:** contains the a notebook with detailed explanations, as well as source code; the recommended file to read, since code-only can be harder to grasp
  * **main.py:** the main file, containing all the code that was used to generate and solve the problem
  * **transformers.py:** file containing the transformers (and imputers) used in the data processing pipelines

## Technical Requirements
In order to properly run the code provided, one needs the following:
  * **Python 3.8.2** - the version it was developed into; any backwards compatible version will work, as well as some previous versions
  * **Scikit-Learn 0.0** - ```pip``` does not want to show the proper version for this package, but any version will work as long as you check for any differences from the code presented
  * **Numpy 1.18.2**
  * **Pandas 1.0.3**
  * **Matplotlib 3.2.1**

> ***Note:** The notebook was made in Kaggle's engine, thus I cannot state any proper version to use.*
