# Housing Prices Advanced Regression Techniques
## Kaggle Competition

This repository contains [my solution](https://www.kaggle.com/filipdutescu/housing-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) to the [***Housing Prices Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle Competition***](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The source code can be found in the following:
  * **[Housing Prices Advanced Regression Techniques.ipynb](Housing%20Prices%20Advanced%20Regression%20Techniques.ipynb):** contains the a notebook with detailed explanations, as well as source code; the recommended file to read, since code-only can be harder to grasp
  * **[main.py](main.py):** the main file, containing all the code that was used to generate and solve the problem
  * **[transformers.py](transformers.py):** file containing the transformers (and imputers) used in the data processing pipelines

## Technical Requirements
In order to properly run the code provided, one needs the following:
  * **Python 3.8.2** - the version it was developed into; any backwards compatible version will work, as well as some previous versions
  * **Scikit-Learn 0.0** - ```pip``` does not want to show the proper version for this package, but any version will work as long as you check for any differences from the code presented
  * **Numpy 1.18.2**
  * **Pandas 1.0.3**
  * **Matplotlib 3.2.1**

> ***Note:** The notebook was made in Kaggle's engine, thus I cannot state any proper version to use. For the Kaggle notebook, please [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/filipdutescu/housing-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).*
